## Session 1: IT Infrastructure Overview

### 1.1 What is IT Infrastructure?

**Definition**: IT infrastructure refers to the collection of physical and virtual resources that support the flow, storage, processing, and analysis of data in an organization. Think of it as the backbone that keeps all the technology in an organization running smoothly, much like a nervous system in the human body.

#### Core Components:
- **Hardware**: Includes servers, storage devices, networking equipment, and client devices (computers, mobile devices).
- **Software**: Operating systems, applications, databases, and management systems that help manage and process the data stored on hardware.
- **Data Centers**: These are specialized facilities that house servers and networking equipment. They provide the infrastructure for storing and processing vast amounts of data.
- **Networks**: Networks, both physical and virtual (like LAN and WAN), ensure that devices can communicate and transfer data between each other.

### 1.2 Key Components of IT Infrastructure

#### 1. **Servers**:
Servers are powerful computers designed to perform specific tasks such as hosting websites, managing databases, or storing files. For example, a server might host your favorite website or store your school’s data.

#### 2. **Storage Systems**:
- **Local Storage**: Hard drives or SSDs attached to individual computers or servers, where all your personal files are stored.
- **Network Storage**: NAS (Network-Attached Storage) and SAN (Storage Area Network) systems allow data to be stored and accessed by multiple devices across a network.

#### 3. **Networking Devices**:
- **Routers**: These direct data traffic between devices and the internet, making sure that emails, websites, and other data reach the right place.
- **Switches**: These allow different devices (computers, printers, etc.) to connect to a single network.
- **Firewalls**: Devices that help protect your network by blocking unwanted data from coming in or out, like a security guard protecting a building.

#### 4. **Virtualization**:
Virtualization allows a single physical hardware system to run multiple virtual environments. This means one computer can act like several computers, saving money and space.

### 1.3 Case Study: IT Infrastructure in Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs)

Imagine a small marketing agency with 50 employees. They need to store client data, host websites, and provide remote access for employees. Here’s how they might set up their IT infrastructure:

#### **Scenario**:
- **Hardware**: They use 2 physical servers. One server is for web hosting, and the other is for storing client files.
- **Network Setup**: The office is connected via a local network with a firewall to ensure security.
- **Virtualization**: The first server runs multiple virtual environments to handle different tasks like web hosting and database management.
- **Cloud Use**: They use cloud services to back up important data and run some applications, like Google Workspace, to make collaboration easier for employees.

## Session 2: Virtualization Concepts

### 2.1 Introduction to Virtualization

**Definition**: Virtualization allows multiple operating systems and applications to run on a single physical server. Think of it as running multiple computers inside one computer.

#### **Benefits**:
1. **Cost Savings**: Fewer physical machines are needed because each physical server can run multiple virtual machines.
2. **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Virtualization ensures that the CPU, memory, and storage are used more effectively.
3. **Scalability**: Businesses can easily add more virtual machines as they grow.
4. **Isolation**: Each virtual environment is independent, which increases security and makes troubleshooting easier.

### 2.2 Virtual Machines (VMs) vs. Containers

#### 1. **Virtual Machines (VMs)**:
- VMs emulate entire operating systems, meaning each VM behaves like a separate computer.
- They have their own dedicated resources, such as RAM and CPU, which makes them secure but slower to boot.
  
#### 2. **Containers**:
- Containers, on the other hand, run isolated applications while sharing the same operating system kernel.
- Containers are lightweight and start much faster than VMs, which makes them ideal for modern application deployment and microservices.

### 2.3 Virtualization Software

#### 1. **Hypervisors**:
- **Type 1 (Bare-metal)**: Installed directly on the physical hardware (e.g., **VMware ESXi**, **Microsoft Hyper-V**). These are typically used in large data centers.
- **Type 2 (Hosted)**: Installed on top of an existing operating system (e.g., **VirtualBox**, **VMware Workstation**). These are used for testing and development on personal computers.

#### 2. **Container Platforms**:
- **Docker**: A popular platform that makes it easy to create, deploy, and run applications in containers.
- **Kubernetes**: Used to manage large numbers of containers and automate their deployment and scaling.

### 2.4 Lab 1: Setting Up a Virtual Machine

**Objective**: Learn how to set up and explore a virtual machine.

**Tools**:
- Use **VirtualBox** or **VMware Workstation**.

**Instructions**:
1. Download and install **VirtualBox**.
2. Create a new virtual machine.
3. Install **Ubuntu Server** on the virtual machine.
4. Explore the virtual environment by creating files, setting up users, and accessing the internet.

## Session 3: Cloud Computing Overview

### 3.1 Cloud Infrastructure Basics

**Definition**: Cloud computing provides on-demand IT resources like storage and processing power over the internet, allowing companies to pay only for what they use. Think of it as renting a powerful computer in the cloud that you can access from anywhere.

#### **Cloud Service Models**:
1. **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Provides virtualized computing resources like virtual machines (e.g., **AWS EC2**, **Azure VMs**).
2. **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Provides platforms for developers to build and deploy applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure (e.g., **Google App Engine**).
3. **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Delivers software applications over the internet (e.g., **Office 365**, **Google Workspace**).

### 3.2 Public vs. Private Cloud

#### 1. **Public Cloud**:
- Services offered by third-party providers over the internet (e.g., **AWS**, **Azure**, **Google Cloud**). It’s like renting storage space or computing power on the internet.

#### 2. **Private Cloud**:
- Cloud infrastructure used exclusively by a single organization, offering more control and security, like having your own private data center.

#### 3. **Hybrid Cloud**:
- A combination of both public and private cloud models, allowing businesses to use the best of both worlds.

### 3.3 Popular Cloud Platforms

#### 1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**:
AWS is the largest cloud service provider in the world, offering a wide range of services like virtual machines, databases, and storage solutions.

#### 2. **Microsoft Azure**:
Azure is widely used by enterprises, especially those already using Microsoft services. It integrates well with tools like Office 365 and Active Directory.

#### 3. **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**:
GCP specializes in big data and machine learning services, making it a popular choice for companies focused on data analytics and AI.

## Session 4: Introduction to Servers

### 4.1 Types of Servers

#### 1. **Web Servers**:
These servers host websites. For example, when you visit Google, your computer connects to one of their web servers. Common web server software includes **Apache** and **Nginx**.

#### 2. **Database Servers**:
Database servers store and manage data. Some common examples include **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**.

#### 3. **File Servers**:
These servers store and manage files, allowing users to upload, download, and share data. Examples include **Samba** and **FTP servers**.

### 4.2 Basic Server Configuration

#### 1. **Windows Server**:
This server system has a graphical user interface, making it easy to manage, especially for beginners. It’s commonly used by businesses that rely on Microsoft products.

#### 2. **Linux Server**:
A more flexible and customizable server system, Linux is often used for open-source projects and web servers. It’s managed through the command line, which requires more technical knowledge.
